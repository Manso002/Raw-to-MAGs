# Evaluating bins using *CheckM*
Now that we have our almost final set of bins, it is a great idea to estimate their completeness (how much of the genome was recovered) and contamination (how many contigs we believe have been incorrectly assigned to that bin). You can read [CheckM](https://github.com/Ecogenomics/CheckM) documentation, since it is really used and powerful. 
```bash
# Create new enviroment and install CheckM and dependencies
conda create -n checkm python=3.9
conda activate checkm
conda install -c bioconda numpy matplotlib pysam
conda install -c bioconda hmmer prodigal pplacer
pip3 install checkm-genome
conda activate checkm
````
Run checkm
```bash
# LIP-1
checkm lineage_wf -t 28 -x fa --tab_table -f checkm-LIP-1.txt ./LIP-1-DasT_DASTool_bins/ LIP-1-checkm
# LIP-2
checkm lineage_wf -t 28 -x fa --tab_table -f checkm-LIP-2.txt ./LIP-2-DasT_DASTool_bins/ LIP-2-checkm
````
How many MAGs did you end up with? Would you filter some of them? Why or why not?
